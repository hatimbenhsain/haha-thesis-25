Did you hear the one about how they got their tail stuck in between two copulating clams?

    Say, have you checked it recently? Have they gotten out yet?
    No, actually don't tell me! I must find out for myself.

NPC: I love kicking off walls! It's my favorite part about swimming!
Do you know how to do it?
+   [Yes.]
    Awesome! So do I!
+   [No.]
    Oh!
    Would you like me to teach you how?!
    ++  [Sure.]
        Ok!
        All you have to do is kick your feet against it!
        +++ [...What?]
            Do you need more instructions?
            You basically just have to rapidly swim away from a wall while being near one.
            Does that make more sense?
            ++++ [Yes.]
                Good!
            ++++ [No.]
                Oh!
                Basically, you need to do a "rapid button press".
                And it only works if you're swimming forward or backward.
                Surely that explains it?
                +++++   [Yes.]
                    Yeah, I figured it would.

                    I don't think there's any other I could help you! It's not that hard.

+   [No.]
    Well do you wanna hear it?
    ++  [Yes.]
        The secret is to keep striding forward frequently, but not so rapidly that you get tired out!
        And in-between, keep pressing onwards so as not to lose your momentum!
        Pretty helpful right?
        +++ [Totally.]
            Yeah, you're welcome!
        +++ [Not really.]
            Oh? Well...
            How about this: bouncing off walls not only gives you a boost, it also preserves your momentum!

                You're welcome.
