By Team Haha (Hatim Benhsain and Hanwen Xu)

A 3D swimming and exploration game about obsession. Become part of a community of merpeople who are evolving to discover casual sex. This is a proof-of-concept build that is meant to showcase most of the game's gameplay features as well as the vibe we are going for. This README file will give a brief description of the vision for each part of the game as well as the controls for each one.


*=== 1. EXPLORATION/SWIMMING ===*

In this part, the player explores the cave where they currently reside and meet other merpeople. Pressing forward repeatedly and at a steady rhythm will make the player go faster.

*=== 2. SINGING/FOREPLAY ===*

In the cave, the player may encounter other merpeople that they can sing with. If they harmonize, they may begin speaking together telepathically. One of the NPCs will propose racing with the protagonist. This will constitute the FOREPLAY portion of sex.

== HARMONIZING ==
The player may harmonize with an NPC by getting close to them and singing a note across from the NPC's note on a five-side polygon. For example, in the example depicted below, if an NPC sings note A, the player may harmonized by singing note C or D.
